## **Federated Learning under Heterogeneous Resource Constraints**

### Participants:

* Jimmy Lin
* Ruofan Liang

### Description:

In the context of federated learning (FL), updates to some parameters are more important than others, since model parameters converge non-uniformly. There might be methods of predicting that some updates are unnecessary. We would like to build a scheduler that generates tasks tailored to the capacity of each device while taking into consideration the non-uniform convergence of parameters.
